# Fringilla, guessing outcomes of NHL games

_Fringilla coelebs - Latin for the Eurasian chaffinch (Bofink, in Swedish)_

Fringilla is a simple PHP/MySql based web application that lets users guess the
outcomes of NHL ice hockey games and keeps tracks of the results. It is based on
the long standing guessing of games in "NHL-bloggen", a blog about NHL in the
Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. This web application is a community effort and
has no affiliation with Aftonbladet.

The application is entirely in Swedish.
